</details>


<details><summary><b>Use Project Creator CLI</b></summary>

The 'project-creator-cli' tool can be used to create applications from a CLI terminal or from within batch files or shell scripts. This tool is available in the *{ModusToolbox&trade; install directory}/tools_{version}/project-creator/* directory.

Use a CLI terminal to invoke the 'project-creator-cli' tool. On Windows, use the command-line 'modus-shell' program provided in the ModusToolbox&trade; installation instead of a standard Windows command-line application. This shell provides access to all ModusToolbox&trade; tools. You can access it by typing "modus-shell" in the search box in the Windows menu. In Linux and macOS, you can use any terminal application.

The following example clones the "[Dual motor control demo](https://github.com/Infineon/mtb-example-ce241420-dual-motor-control)" application with the desired name "DualMotorDemo" configured for the *KIT_PSC3M5_CC2* BSP into the specified working directory, *C:/mtb_projects*:

   ```
   project-creator-cli --board-id KIT_PSC3M5_CC2 --app-id mtb-example-ce241420-dual-motor-control --user-app-name DualMotorDemo --target-dir "C:/mtb_projects"
   ```

The 'project-creator-cli' tool has the following arguments:

Argument | Description | Required/optional
---------|-------------|-----------
`--board-id` | Defined in the <id> field of the [BSP](https://github.com/Infineon?q=bsp-manifest&type=&language=&sort=) manifest | Required
`--app-id`   | Defined in the <id> field of the [CE](https://github.com/Infineon?q=ce-manifest&type=&language=&sort=) manifest | Required
`--target-dir`| Specify the directory in which the application is to be created if you prefer not to use the default current working directory | Optional
`--user-app-name`| Specify the name of the application if you prefer to have a name other than the example's default name | Optional

<br>

> **Note:** The project-creator-cli tool uses the `git clone` and `make getlibs` commands to fetch the repository and import the required libraries. For details, see the "Project creator tools" section of the [ModusToolbox&trade; tools package user guide](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxUserGuide) (locally available at {ModusToolbox&trade; install directory}/docs_{version}/mtb_user_guide.pdf).

## Design and implementation

This code example is created using the PSOC&trade; Control C3 MCU resources and Infineon motor control library (middleware asset).

The following are the major control types that are supported:
- Rotor Field Oriented (RFO) control
- Stator Field Oriented (SFO) control
- Trapezoidal Block Commutation (TBC)

These control types are selectable from application make as build configurations in ModusToolbox&trade;.

By choosing a specific build configuration, only the code pertaining to that build configuration is compiled and included. Also, there are common code blocks among all build configurations that are always included.

After selecting the control type through build configurations, choose the *controlled entity*, *feedback type*, and *startup method* by assigning the corresponding parameters either in the code (*configuration* > *motor-ctrl-lib-config* > *ParamConfig.h*) before compilation or at runtime through the GUI.

**Figure 6. Control methods**

![](images/control-methods.png)

There are 23 different permutations of control type, control entity, feedback type, and startup methods that are supported as shown in **Figure 6**. Additionally, both three-shunt and single-shunt configurations are supported, which result in more flexibility in supporting various applications.

Note that you can either include or bypass the current loop when using *TBC in TC* mode. Bypassing the current loop can address low-cost BLDC applications with no shunts or ADCs.
